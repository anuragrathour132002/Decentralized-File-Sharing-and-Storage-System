# Decentralized File Sharing and Storage System

# Technologies: Blockchain, IPFS, Solidity, React.js, Ether.js

1. Led the design and development of a secure decentralized file-sharing and storage system using blockchain and IPFS technology, enhancing data integrity, privacy, and resilience against breaches.
   
2. Developed and integrated smart contracts using Solidity to implement robust access control mechanisms, ensuring only authorized users can access and share files.
   
3. Improved user interface with React.js and Ether.js for seamless interaction, and optimized system scalability through advanced caching and network protocol strategies.
   
4. Conducted performance optimization to reduce latency and improve file transfer speeds, ensuring efficient resource utilization and system reliability under high user load conditions.
